1) Data

		Source of the variable data:  These come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

		Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

		Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 


2) Variable Information

	Above signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
	'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

	tBodyAcc-XYZ
	tGravityAcc-XYZ
	tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
	tBodyGyro-XYZ
	tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
	tBodyAccMag
	tGravityAccMag
	tBodyAccJerkMag
	tBodyGyroMag
	tBodyGyroJerkMag
	fBodyAcc-XYZ
	fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
	fBodyGyro-XYZ
	fBodyAccMag
	fBodyAccJerkMag
	fBodyGyroMag
	fBodyGyroJerkMag

	The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

	mean(): Mean value
	std(): Standard deviation
	mad(): Median absolute deviation 
	max(): Largest value in array
	min(): Smallest value in array
	sma(): Signal magnitude area
	energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
	iqr(): Interquartile range 
	entropy(): Signal entropy
	arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
	correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
	maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
	meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
	skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
	kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
	bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
	angle(): Angle between to vectors.

	Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

	gravityMean
	tBodyAccMean
	tBodyAccJerkMean
	tBodyGyroMean
	tBodyGyroJerkMean



3) Transformations

	i) There were 561 variables in the training and test data set.
	ii) Transformations were done on one data set at time.
	iii) All these variables from train data were assigned name(column names) from the features list.
	iv) These feature names were transformed in such a way that the function icons like "()","-" were replaced with either space or the underscrore("_") 
	v) Then only the column having the mean and standard deviation data were retained.
	vi) Activity and subject information was added to the data with cbind() function.
	vii) Steps ii through vi were performed for test data too.
	viii) Later on both train and test data (with  added activity column and subject column) were combined with rbind() function.
	ix) Now  aggregate() function was caleld on the combined data frame to get mean of every column for each combination of the Subject and Activity.
	x) Finally the data  frame was writtent to the TEXT file with write.table() function having row.name argument.as FALSE.
